# Machine Learning Engineer

Turning Adversity into Triumph with Positivity and Perseverance!

Dynamic ML Engineer with 5 years of experience in deploying and optimizing machine learning models, specializing in NLP. Proficient in using advanced frameworks like Large Language Models, with a strong software development and data science background. Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, recognized for problem-solving, creativity, and collaborative mindset, delivering pragmatic solutions in fast-paced environments.

### My Latest Work:

#### Domain-Specific Chatbot with RAG trained for Q&A LLM Specific Research Papers using Agents in Llama_index 
Developed domain-specific chat based agents to answer detailed document-based questions, perform Q&A and summarization tasks, handle multiple documents, and integrated these agents into a user-friendly Streamlit app with visualized reasoning processes.

#### Evaluation and Optimization of RAG Applications with RAGAS and Trulens: 
Enhanced the RAG pipeline using advanced retrieval techniques like sentence window retrieval and auto-merging retrieval, evaluated the RAG models based on context relevancy, answer relevancy and groundedness.
