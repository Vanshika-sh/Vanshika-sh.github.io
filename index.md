## My Latest Work:
### Multi-document Agentic RAG with LLama Index, GPT-3.5 Turbo, deployed with Streamlit

- Developed an agent using GPT-3.5 Turbo model capable of answering complex questions based on documents.
- Discovered how to construct an agent that can reason over documents and provide answers to intricate questions based on them.
- Built a router agent to assist with Q&A and summarization tasks, and learnt how to extend it to pass arguments effectively.
- Designed a research agent for handling multiple documents, and explore various methods to debug and control this agent.
- Integrated the above agents into a Streamlit app to create a user-friendly interface for interacting with your agents.
- Visualized the agent's reasoning process and displayed the answers to complex questions.

### Evaluation and Optimization of RAG Applications using RAGAs and Trulens

- Improved the RAG pipeline using advanced retrieval techniques such as sentence-window retrieval and auto-merging retrieval.
- Adopted evaluation best practices, focusing on Context Relevance, Groundedness, and Answer Relevance to ensure robust and reliable outputs.
- Developed a Streamlit app to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the advanced RAG applications.
- Utilized Streamlit components to visualize the agent's reasoning process with trace logs, dependency graphs, and interactive elements.
- Deployed the app by installing Streamlit, creating and testing the app locally, and using cloud platforms like Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or AWS for broader accessibility.
