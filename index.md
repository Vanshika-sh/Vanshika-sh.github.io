## Machine Learning Engineer

Turning Adversity into Triumph with Positivity and Perseverance!


Dynamic ML Engineer with 5 years of experience in deploying and optimizing machine learning models, specializing in NLP. Proficient in using advanced frameworks like Large Language Models, with a strong software development and data science background. Master’s in Computer Science, recognized for problem-solving, creativity, and collaborative mindset, delivering pragmatic solutions in fast-paced environments.

### My Latest Work:

#### Multi-document Agentic RAG with LlamaIndex, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and Streamlit: 
Developed agents to answer complex document-based questions, perform Q&A and summarization tasks, handle multiple documents, and integrated these agents into a user-friendly Streamlit app with visualized reasoning processes.

#### Evaluation and Optimization of RAG Applications with RAGAs and Trulens: 
Enhanced the RAG pipeline using advanced retrieval techniques, implemented best evaluation practices, created a Streamlit app for interaction, visualized the agent’s reasoning, and deployed the app using cloud platforms like Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or AWS.
  
### Refined Skills on:
