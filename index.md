### My Latest Work:

#### Domain-Specific Chatbot with RAG trained for Q&A LLM Specific Research Papers using Agents in Llama_index 
Developed domain-specific chat based agents to answer detailed document-based questions, perform Q&A and summarization tasks, handle multiple documents, and integrated these agents into a user-friendly Streamlit app with visualized reasoning processes.

#### Evaluation and Optimization of RAG Applications with RAGAS and Trulens: 
Enhanced the RAG pipeline using advanced retrieval techniques like sentence window retrieval and auto-merging retrieval, evaluated the RAG models based on context relevancy, answer relevancy and groundedness.

### Finetuning FLAN-T5 and LLama3 using PEFT Techniques like LoRA and QLoRA
- Setup Environment: Installed necessary libraries (transformers, datasets, peft, torch) and configured the environment.
- Data Preparation: Loaded and preprocessed datasets, then tokenized them using respective tokenizers.
- Model Initialization: Loaded pre-trained FLAN-T5 and LLama3 models and initialized LoRA/QLoRA modules.
- Configure PEFT: Integrated LoRA/QLoRA with the models and set configuration parameters (rank, alpha, dropout).
- Training and Evaluation: Defined training parameters, trained the models, evaluated on validation sets, and saved the fine-tuned models.
  
### Refined Skills on:
- Agent development, document analysis, Streamlit integration, visualizing reasoning processes.
- Retrieval optimization techniques, evaluation metrics, cloud deployment
