## Projects
In this space, I will be sharing insights and detailed processes of various projects I have worked on, along with my learnings from each.

### Domain-Specific Chatbot Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs)

- Developed an agent using GPT-4 model capable of answering complex questions based on documents.
- Constructed an agent that combines retrieval-based and generative approaches to produce accurate and contextually relevant responses.
- Built a retrieval system using techniques like TF-IDF and BM25, and created vector embeddings for domain specific documents and queries using vector databases.
- Integrated a generative model fine-tuned on a domain-specific corpus to improve understanding and generation capabilities.
- Created a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, allowing seamless interaction with the chatbot for domain-specific queries.
- Addressed challenges such as data privacy, maintaining accuracy, handling ambiguity, and ensuring scalability.

### Evaluation and Optimization of RAG Applications using RAGAs and Trulens

- Improved the RAG pipeline using advanced retrieval techniques such as sentence-window retrieval and auto-merging retrieval.
- Adopted evaluation best practices, focusing on Context Relevance, Groundedness, and Answer Relevance to ensure robust and reliable outputs.
- Developed a Streamlit app to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the advanced RAG applications.
- Utilized Streamlit components to visualize the agent's reasoning process with trace logs, dependency graphs, and interactive elements.
- Deployed the app by installing Streamlit, creating and testing the app locally, and using cloud platforms like Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or AWS for broader accessibility.
